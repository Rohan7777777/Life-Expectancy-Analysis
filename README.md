# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

# 🧬 Life Expectancy Analysis

This project investigates global life expectancy trends using a dataset containing health, demographic, and economic indicators for multiple countries over time.

### 🔍 Key Objectives
- Perform comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Uncover relationships between variables and **Life Expectancy**
- Compare **developed vs. developing** nations
- Build **regression models** (Linear, Random Forest) to predict life expectancy
- Visualize top contributing features with importance plots

### 📊 Data Highlights
- Health indicators: HIV/AIDS, Alcohol use, Vaccination, BMI
- Economic data: GDP, Total Expenditure, Income Index
- Social factors: Schooling, Infant deaths, Thinness
- Coverage: 190+ countries, multiple years

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn (ML models)
- Statsmodels (for optional time series decomposition)
